# Weather_Dashboard

This website is a Weather Dashboard writen mostly with Java Script and html. This website displays today's temperature as well as the next 5 days forecast. I used local storage to store the search history and https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api to fetch the weather data and city coordinates. I also used moment.js for data display and bootstrap as a css framework.
